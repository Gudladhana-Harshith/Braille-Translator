# Braille-Translator
The Braille Translator Project is an innovative application that utilizes a combination of technologies, including Flask, OpenCV, Optical Braille Recognition (OBR), and a Web Synthesizer, to facilitate seamless translation of printed text into Braille for visually impaired individuals.
This project aims to bridge the accessibility gap by providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for converting textual information into a format that can be easily read and understood by Braille readers.
